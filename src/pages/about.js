        <span className="emph">CK</span> is a vocalist, arranger, music producer, audio engineer and software engineer who was born and raised in Quezon City, Philippines. He attended university at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and majored in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, with concentrations in music and media studies.
